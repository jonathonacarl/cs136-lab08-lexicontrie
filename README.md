# CS136 Lab: Super Lexicon

* Virtually all modern word processors contain a feature to check the spelling of words in documents. More advanced word processors also provide suggested corrections for misspelled words. In this project, we will be implementing such a spelling corrector through a highly-efficient Lexicon class.
